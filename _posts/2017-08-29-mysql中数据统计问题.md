做报表的需求，需要统计线上某时间数据，时间一般用时间戳即毫秒值来做记录，但是跑数据的时候提示
**BIGINT UNSIGNED value is out of range**

As of MySQL 5.5.5, overflow during numeric expression evaluation results in an error. For example, the largest signed BIGINT value is 9223372036854775807, so the following expression produces an error.

A change to part of your query, as following, would solve the issue.

( CAST( quantity AS SIGNED ) - COUNT( game_moblist.spawn_id ) ) AS quantity_to_spawn
Otherwise you may require to change the sql_mode on unsigned operations.

mysql> SET sql_mode = 'NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION';
and then run your query to get desired output.

select floor(floor(sum(cast(finish_time as signed) - cast(start_time as signed))/1000)/count(session_id)) master_video_time
        from video_session
        where
        start_time >= #{startTime}
        and start_time <= #{endTime}
