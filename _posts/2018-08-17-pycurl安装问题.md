1. 使用安装第三方插件的方式安装pycurl：pip3 install pycurl

报错提示如下：

Curl is configured to use SSL, but we have not been able to determine which SSL backend it is using. Please see PycURL documentation for how to specify the SSL backend manually.'

2. pip and cached pycurl package

# upgrade pip if necessary
pip install --upgrade pip

# remove current pycurl
pip uninstall pycurl

# set PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY
export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=nss

# recompile and install pycurl
pip install --compile pycurl
